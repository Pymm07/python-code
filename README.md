# python-code

This is my running working python code for adress book it starts off as 5 varibles per person that will all do different things
Theres the name, age, email, grade, drivers licence.
The name and email is placed into a string for each person and in the string I would print their name and email.
The age is placed into a float which makes it so you can add decimals into the hundreds.
The grade is placed into a intenger so you can display numbers. 
The Driver's Licences is in a bool so it would make it a true or false statement or a yes, or no.
The actual output of the code is that it would display as an ID format.
